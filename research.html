          Several areas of research are currently being explored to advance the
          development of self-driving cars. Some of the notable research areas
          include:<br />
          <br />
          Sensor Technology: Researchers are focusing on improving the
          capabilities of sensors used in self-driving cars, such as cameras,
          lidar, radar, and ultrasonic sensors. This includes enhancing their
          resolution, range, and reliability to enable better perception of the
          surrounding environment. <br />
          <br />
          Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence: Advancements in machine
          learning algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) are crucial for
          self-driving cars. Researchers are working on developing more
          sophisticated algorithms that can handle complex decision-making
          processes, learn from real-world scenarios, and adapt to changing
          environments <br />
          <br />
          Ethical Decision-Making: Researchers are grappling with the ethical
          dilemmas faced by self-driving cars. They are investigating approaches
          to incorporate ethical considerations into the decision-making
          algorithms of autonomous systems, ensuring that the technology aligns
          with societal values and follows legal and moral principles.
